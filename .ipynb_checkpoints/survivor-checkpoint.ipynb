    "## Assignment: Survivor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will test all the skills that you have learned during this course to manipulate the provided data to find the answers to questions about the TV show Survivor.  If you are not familiar with this show, start by watching this short clip that briefly explains it:  [Survivor Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1-hTpG_krk)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that your notebook should be named `survivor` when submitting to CodeGrade for the automatic grading to work properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Survivor data is a R package from Daniel Oehm.  Daniel has made the data for this package available as an Excel file as explained in his article on [gradientdescending.com](http://gradientdescending.com/survivor-data-from-the-tv-series-in-r/).  Please make sure that you use the file from our Brightspace page though to make sure that your data will match what CodeGrade is expecting.  We have also updated some errors in the file, which is another reason that you must use the data given to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to first read the article on the website linked above.  This will give you additional details about the data that will be important as you answer the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that there is a data dictionary in the file that explains the columns in the data.  You will also want to become familiar with the various spreadsheets and column names.  This will help you out tremendously in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, here are a couple of things to know for those of you that have not seen the show:\n",
    "- Survivor is a reality TV show that first aired May 31, 2000 and is currently still on TV.\n",
    "- Contestants are broken up into two teams (usually) where they live in separate camps. \n",
    "- The teams compete in various challenges for rewards (food, supplies, brief experience trips, etc) and tribal immunity.  \n",
    "- The team that loses a challenge, and therefore doesn't get the tribal immunity, goes to tribal council where they have to vote one of their members out (this data is represented in the \"Vote History\" spreadsheet).\n",
    "- After there are a small number of contestants left, the tribes are merged into one tribe where each contestant competes for individual immunity.  The winner of the individual immunity cannot get voted out and is safe at the next tribal council.\n",
    "- The are also hidden immunity idols that are hidden around the campground.  If a contestant finds and plays their hidden immunity at the tribal council, then all votes against them do not count, and the player with the next highest number of votes goes home.\n",
    "- When the contestants get down to 2 or 3 people, a number of the last contestants, known as the jury, come back to vote for the person who they think should win the game.  The winner is the one who gets the most jury votes (this data is represented in the \"Jury Votes\" spreadsheet).  This person is known as the Sole Survivor.\n",
    "- Voting recap: \n",
    "    - Tribal Council votes (Vote History spreadsheet) are bad; contestants with the most votes get sent home\n",
    "    - Jury Votes (Jury Votes spreadsheet) are good; contestants with the most votes win the game and is the Sole Survivor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Show Work</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you must show your work.  Students submissions are spot checked manually to verify that they are not hard coding the answer from looking only in the file or in CodeGrade's expected output.  If this is seen, the student's answer will be manually marked wrong and their grade will be changed to reflect this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the question is who is the contestant who has received the most tribal votes to be voted out.  Select their record from the `castaway_details` DataFrame.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You would show your work and code similar to this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "### incorrect way ###\n",
    "Q1 = castaway_details[castaway_details['castaway_id'] ==  333]\n",
    "\n",
    "### correct way - showing your work ###\n",
    "# get index\n",
    "idx = vote_history.groupby('vote_id').size().sort_values(ascending=False).index[0]\n",

    "# select row based on index \n",
    "Q1 = castaway_details[castaway_details['castaway_id'] ==  idx]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Use Copy</u>\n",

    "Don't change any of the original DataFrames unless specifically asked or CodeGrade will not work correctly for this assignment.  Make sure you use `copy()` if needed."
